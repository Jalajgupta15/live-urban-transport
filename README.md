# 🚗 Real-Time Vehicle Analytics Pipeline

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **real-time data analytics pipeline** built to simulate, process, and visualize live vehicle data.
The system ingests streaming data, processes it using Spark Streaming, stores analytical results, and exposes them through APIs for dashboards and BI tools like Power BI.

The main goal of this project was to **understand end-to-end data flow in a real-time system**—from data generation to analytics consumption—using industry-relevant tools and design patterns.

---

## 🧠 What I Built

* A **live data generator** to simulate vehicle movement data
* A **Spark Streaming processor** to analyze streaming data in near real time
* A **CSV-based analytics layer** for simplicity and debuggability
* A **Flask backend API** to serve processed metrics
* A **frontend / BI-ready interface** to consume and visualize data

This project focuses on **architecture clarity, data flow, and scalability**, rather than UI-heavy implementation.

## ⚙️ Component Explanation

### 1️⃣ Data Generator (`vehicle_stream_producer.py`)

* Simulates real-time vehicle events (speed, location, vehicle ID, etc.)
* Acts as a streaming data source for Spark

---

### 2️⃣ Spark Streaming (`stream_processor.py`)

* Consumes live vehicle data
* Performs aggregations and transformations
* Writes analytics output as timestamped CSV files

Example metrics:

* Average speed per vehicle
* Vehicle activity counts
* Time-based aggregations

---

### 3️⃣ Analytics Export (`powerbi_export.py`)

* Reads the **latest Spark-generated CSV**
* Adds a `last_updated` timestamp
* Writes a stable output file:
  `storage/csv/latest_metrics.csv`

This design ensures:

* Easy Power BI integration
* No dependency on changing filenames
* Simple debugging and inspection

---

### 4️⃣ Backend API (`api_server.py`)

* Built using Flask
* Exposes processed analytics via REST endpoint

**Endpoint**

```
GET /data
```

**Response**

* JSON-formatted analytics records
* Reads directly from `latest_metrics.csv`

This allows:

* Frontend dashboards
* External tools
* BI platforms to consume the same data source

---

### 5️⃣ Frontend (`web/`)

* Lightweight HTML + JavaScript
* Fetches data from Flask API
* Displays near real-time analytics

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

Make sure you have:

* Python
* Apache Spark
* Required Python libraries (`pandas`, `flask`, etc.)

---

### 2️⃣ Start the Pipeline

```bash
bash scripts/run_pipeline.sh
```

This script:

* Starts the data generator
* Runs Spark streaming
* Launches the Flask API

---

### 3️⃣ Access the API

```
http://localhost:5000/data
```

---

### 4️⃣ Power BI Integration

* Connect Power BI to:

```
storage/csv/latest_metrics.csv
```

* Refresh periodically for near real-time insights

---

## ✅ Key Design Decisions

* **CSV-based exchange layer** for simplicity and transparency
* **Decoupled architecture** between Spark, API, and frontend
* **Single stable output file** for BI tools
* **API-first approach** for extensibility

This design can later be extended to:

* Databases (PostgreSQL, DuckDB)
* Parquet storage
* Kafka-based production pipelines
